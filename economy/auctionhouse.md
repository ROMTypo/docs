# Auction House

The auction house allows you to sell items through a GUI instead of using [ChestShops](/economy/chestshop).
You have a limited number of items you can sell through the auction house, and it's great for selling unique items.

## How to sell an item

Hold the item you want to sell in your hand (stacks will work) and type `/ah sell` to get information about it.
