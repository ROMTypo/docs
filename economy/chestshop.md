# ChestShop

ChestShop allows people to sell mass amounts of the same item, like food.

## Creating a ChestShop

Place a chest, and right above it make a sign.

The sign should look like the above sign.

For the `item amount` put 64 for a stack. For `price` put the amount without the dollar sign, so `100`. For the item name, I found it's the easiest to set it to `?` then complete the sign.

A message will appear in chat saying to right click the sign with the item you want to sell, filling in the item name. Next just fill up the chest with whatever you are selling and you are done!

## Destroying a ChestShop

Break the sign, and you're done.
