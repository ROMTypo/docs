# EXP Bottling

You can buy Exp Bottles to store and trade your xp. Bottles can be bought using the `/bottles get <number>`
command. If you'd like to buy as many bottles as you can, specify `all` as the number. You can recover
the xp by smashing the bottles like normal.

Bottles hold x10 the experience as vanilla bottles.
