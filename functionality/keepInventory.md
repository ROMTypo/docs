## Inventory Insurance

You can enable keepInventory for a limited time by purchasing inventory insurance.
Inventory insurance initially costs $1000 to purchase and then costs $100 per minute
while active. If you die while your insurance is enabled, you'll keep your inventory.
You'll receive a notification when money is withdrawn. After dying, your insurance expires
and you must pay the initial $1000 fee again.

If you kill a player with inventory insurance enabled, you'll win a prize to compensate
for their inventory which won't be dropped.

Inventory insurance will be disabled if you go offline, so don't forget to turn it back on.
