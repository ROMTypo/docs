# Claiming

You can protect your land from unauthorized building by right clicking two corners with a golden shovel.
Each claim claims from bedrock to build limit, so you don't need to worry about height.
You are restricted by how many "blocks" you can claim, and the remaining amount is displayed on the sidebar.
You can buy more with the in-game currency with `/buyclaimblocks` and sell with `/sellclaimblocks` you can buy
one claim block for $10 and sell it for $8 each.

## Trusting people

If you don't trust anyone, only you will have access to your chests and redstone contraptions.
If you would like someone to access your chests, execute `/containertrust Username` to allow them
to open your containers.
If you would like to allow them to build, execute `/trust Username`
